# Requirements

This document details the goal of this website and a list of features needed.

The goal is to be able to build simple websites that will generate code for you. The mechanism aims to be similar to figma where you can drag and drop items easily around a canvas. This will of course result in the code generated being more disorganised and complicated.

To be able to measure this I aim to be able to create my own portfolio website using the code generated. In order to achieve that I need these features:

- Headings
- Divs
- Paragraphs
- Links
- Changing the page title
- Changing page width
- Changing fonts
- Simple animations such as reveal on scroll
- Ability to add images
- Ability to create responsive pages using breakpoints
- Sign up/login to save website

Here are additional features that can make the website easier to use but are not necessary:

- Doing math in inputs
